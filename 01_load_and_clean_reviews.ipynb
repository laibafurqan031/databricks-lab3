This beast weighs 8.4 pounds empty, so it is obviously made to withstand almost anything. The Pelican laptop compartment is waterproof, crush proof, and has room for a decent size laptop (15.50&#8243; long x 10.50&#8243; width x 1.50&#8243; deep). The cloth material is 1000 denier nylon, which is much thicker than most non-military grade backpacks. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds, a Pelican case and a very durable backpack.Who would need such a backpack? Anyone who puts their computer at risk. I take my laptop to and from work in a car with a lot of other equipment. My laptop is subject to being knocked around, short falls, or having other equipment tossed on top of it. This backpack would also be great for soldiers, frequent travelers, motorcycle riders, or anyone who takes their computer to inhospitable environments. This has got to be one of the most protective computer backpacks on earth.I stumbled upon this backpack after writing on my website about a laptop sleeve I purchased to protect my MacBook Pro. This laptop sleeve would be sufficient for most people, but I wanted something offering extreme protection. I considered a standard Pelican case (briefcase style), but that would not have room for the other equipment I need to carry with me on a regular basis. Everything pointed to the Pelican U100 backpack.The Pelican U100 backpack is a bit expensive at a retail price of $269.86. I checked Amazon and it was much cheaper around $185. This was more than I am used to paying for a computer backpack, but it would be cheaper than replacing a high-end laptop. I also feel this laptop is a good deal at the price on Amazon.The plastic laptop compartment is padded, but the padding is thin and not the normal Pelican case padding. It is obvious this was needed to keep the dimensions of the compartment reasonably sized. Newer laptops, MacBooks, and &#8220;ultrabooks&#8221; are thin so Pelican included padded spacers. I have a MacBook Pro 13 and the two spacers for this model laptop may be sufficient, but I still may look at adding padding that is more substantial. I may take padding from another Pelican case and line the compartment with it.In addition to the plastic laptop storage case, the backpack itself has three main storage compartments:1. The front compartment is thin and has room for an iPad just behind the plastic protective face. There is also room for pens, notepads, or other smaller items. There is also a zippered pouch in this area.2. The next compartment is slightly above the compartment above and takes up about 1/3 of the pack height. This compartment can expand to a decent depth, but it will take room from the third and largest compartment.3. The last and largest compartment runs the length of the pack and can expand to hold a decent amount of gear (one or two days clothes).*There is a somewhat hidden compartment on the back of the backpack that is accessed by moving the shoulder straps out of the way. This compartment is not meant to hold much and I could see it being used for documents that need to be kept flat. I would bet the only reason this pocket is there is for accessing the plastic laptop case in case of repair.Though a bit expensive and somewhat heavy compared to normal computer packpacks, I highly recommend the Pelican U100 if you need (or want) serious protection for your laptop. Be sure to check your laptop dimensions to make sure there is enough room in the plastic case (15.50&#8243; long x 10.50&#8243; width x 1.50&#8243; deep).</td><td>5.0</td><td>Extreme Computer Backpack for Extreme Conditions</td><td>1365897600</td><td>04 14, 2013</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>A2CFASA1EXUKC2</td><td>B008K4PGX4</td><td>Robert Ramirez</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>Very cool backpack.

It carries easily, if a bit stiff, and has wide comfortable straps complete with load lifters to pull the load closer to your back and better stabilize the load. The rubber handle is amazing and every bag should come with something like this even without a protective case. The gel in the straps is superior to thicker foam I have had in other bags. There are some things I don't like right off the bat and I will update this as my experience with them changes.Cons:No waistbelt means longer trips with this will not be as comfortable as it could be but I consider this very minor in a laptop bag however a waistbelt and load lifters compliment each other.The front two zippered areas have more limited storage than my previous bags so I am reorganizing where I carry certain things and perhaps getting a cable organizer to keep things in the main compartment but not have them all bouncing around. (chargers, hard drives, USB cables, USB drives, etc.)One limited set of M.O.L.L.E. in a weird place - I carry a ball cap and some paracord attached to a carabiner and sometimes a rainshell and I like to clip them to external rings or molle. This pack does not have great ability for external attachments. I will try and work around this but nothing is coming to mind right now.MADE IN CHINA! - I'm getting old but I think a $200 dollar bag shouldn't be made in China, I actually wouldn't have bought it if I had known this as I like to try and buy American.</td><td>4.0</td><td>First trip review</td><td>1370995200</td><td>06 12, 2013</td><td>2013</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

This beast weighs 8.4 pounds empty, so it is obviously made to withstand almost anything. The Pelican laptop compartment is waterproof, crush proof, and has room for a decent size laptop (15.50&#8243; long x 10.50&#8243; width x 1.50&#8243; deep). The cloth material is 1000 denier nylon, which is much thicker than most non-military grade backpacks. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds, a Pelican case and a very durable backpack.Who would need such a backpack? Anyone who puts their computer at risk. I take my laptop to and from work in a car with a lot of other equipment. My laptop is subject to being knocked around, short falls, or having other equipment tossed on top of it. This backpack would also be great for soldiers, frequent travelers, motorcycle riders, or anyone who takes their computer to inhospitable environments. This has got to be one of the most protective computer backpacks on earth.I stumbled upon this backpack after writing on my website about a laptop sleeve I purchased to protect my MacBook Pro. This laptop sleeve would be sufficient for most people, but I wanted something offering extreme protection. I considered a standard Pelican case (briefcase style), but that would not have room for the other equipment I need to carry with me on a regular basis. Everything pointed to the Pelican U100 backpack.The Pelican U100 backpack is a bit expensive at a retail price of $269.86. I checked Amazon and it was much cheaper around $185. This was more than I am used to paying for a computer backpack, but it would be cheaper than replacing a high-end laptop. I also feel this laptop is a good deal at the price on Amazon.The plastic laptop compartment is padded, but the padding is thin and not the normal Pelican case padding. It is obvious this was needed to keep the dimensions of the compartment reasonably sized. Newer laptops, MacBooks, and &#8220;ultrabooks&#8221; are thin so Pelican included padded spacers. I have a MacBook Pro 13 and the two spacers for this model laptop may be sufficient, but I still may look at adding padding that is more substantial. I may take padding from another Pelican case and line the compartment with it.In addition to the plastic laptop storage case, the backpack itself has three main storage compartments:1. The front compartment is thin and has room for an iPad just behind the plastic protective face. There is also room for pens, notepads, or other smaller items. There is also a zippered pouch in this area.2. The next compartment is slightly above the compartment above and takes up about 1/3 of the pack height. This compartment can expand to a decent depth, but it will take room from the third and largest compartment.3. The last and largest compartment runs the length of the pack and can expand to hold a decent amount of gear (one or two days clothes).*There is a somewhat hidden compartment on the back of the backpack that is accessed by moving the shoulder straps out of the way. This compartment is not meant to hold much and I could see it being used for documents that need to be kept flat. I would bet the only reason this pocket is there is for accessing the plastic laptop case in case of repair.Though a bit expensive and somewhat heavy compared to normal computer packpacks, I highly recommend the Pelican U100 if you need (or want) serious protection for your laptop. Be sure to check your laptop dimensions to make sure there is enough room in the plastic case (15.50&#8243; long x 10.50&#8243; width x 1.50&#8243; deep).</td><td>5.0</td><td>Extreme Computer Backpack for Extreme Conditions</td><td>1365897600</td><td>04 14, 2013</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>A2CFASA1EXUKC2</td><td>B008K4PGX4</td><td>Robert Ramirez</td><td>List(0, 0)</td><td>Very cool backpack.

It carries easily, if a bit stiff, and has wide comfortable straps complete with load lifters to pull the load closer to your back and better stabilize the load. The rubber handle is amazing and every bag should come with something like this even without a protective case. The gel in the straps is superior to thicker foam I have had in other bags. There are some things I don't like right off the bat and I will update this as my experience with them changes.Cons:No waistbelt means longer trips with this will not be as comfortable as it could be but I consider this very minor in a laptop bag however a waistbelt and load lifters compliment each other.The front two zippered areas have more limited storage than my previous bags so I am reorganizing where I carry certain things and perhaps getting a cable organizer to keep things in the main compartment but not have them all bouncing around. (chargers, hard drives, USB cables, USB drives, etc.)One limited set of M.O.L.L.E. in a weird place - I carry a ball cap and some paracord attached to a carabiner and sometimes a rainshell and I like to clip them to external rings or molle. This pack does not have great ability for external attachments. I will try and work around this but nothing is coming to mind right now.MADE IN CHINA! - I'm getting old but I think a $200 dollar bag shouldn't be made in China, I actually wouldn't have bought it if I had known this as I like to try and buy American.</td><td>4.0</td><td>First trip review</td><td>1370995200</td><td>06 12, 2013</td><td>2013</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"
